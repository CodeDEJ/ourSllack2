# Sllacker

Group Project: Sllacker

Sllacker is a web messaging application that facilitates collaboration 
within  teams and organizations  to exchange information. Our 
application unifies people by creating a hub that allows teams to 
interact through workspaces and other tools that manage internal 
communications. 

The application is versatile; channels and threads can be created or 
removed at will, and employees can hop in and out of conversations.
Sllacker will provide digital workspaces and ecosystems for schools, 
small businesses and organizations.

Sllacker fulfills a need in the professional environment where people 
often say that their daily standups and emails feel like chores. Posting 
your standup in a Sllacker channel will ease the pressure of meetings 
and calls that can unfortunately last a lot longer than the prescribed 15
minutes.

Our Collaborators include individuals straight from Zip Code 
Wilmington to recreate the web application slack.
Tools:

We will be using Java/Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend 
development.  The frontend development will be handled by React and
hosted on EC2.
